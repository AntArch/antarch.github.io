## Tasks rolled over for the next sprint

# Retrospective



## What went well?

## What have we learnt?

## What could we do better?


## What still puzzles us?



## What is blocking activity


# Task summary

## Repository presentation Darren

Follow up meeting scheduled for Tuesday (or Wednesday)

Darren tasked me to do some repository research for a ‘walled garden’ international project he is a theme leader on. He presented this last week.

## Start ingest of ABP data into POSTGRES environment


## Get Darren in contact with the utility sector



Dear Jo,

I hope all is well. I know it’s been a while since I was last in touch – but I have been watching the progress since MTU and VISTA. I not the consortium has built some good follow on projects.

It was on the point of the consortium that I wanted to contact you. I now have a part-time Research Fellow position in Nottingham and have been in post nearly two months (in passing with my other hat on I’m also consulting at United Utilities). This is to undertake *smart cities* research (a term which is frowned upon – but cuts to the chase). Our PI is [Prof Darren Robinson](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/abe/people/darren.robinson).

One of Darren’s projects is called InSMART and can be summarised as follows:

>The [InSMART project](http://www.insmartenergy.com/) brings together cities, scientific and industrial organizations in order to implement a comprehensive model for enhancing sustainable planning addressing the current and future city energy needs through an integrative and multidisciplinary planning approach. This approach will identify the optimum mix of short, medium and long term measures for a sustainable energy future, addressing the efficiency of energy flows across various city sectors with regards to economic, environmental and social criteria and paving the way towards actual implementation of priority actions.

The project I am working on is called Sustaining Urban Habitats (website under construction) – which builds on the approaches developed in InSMART.

The projects could benefit from grater input from the utility sector: utilities are a provider of critical city infrastructure and are a key stakeholder (improving operational and policy impacts) and  there is a need for utility data to improve the modelling process. My thoughts turned to you – there is some overlap of interests here. These projects would benefit from your cross-utility approach and the insights you can offer from a data, operational and policy perspective.

Anyway – I ‘ll leave it to the two of you to pick up.

## Get in touch with Data Analytics people

Data analytics at Nottingham

Dear John  and James,

My name is Anthony Beck I am a recently appointed part-time Research Fellow on the [Leverhulme Trust](http://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/) funded project [Sustaining Urban Habitats - an interdisciplinary approach](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/environmental-physics-and-design/leverhulme-project.aspx) led by [Prof Darren Robinson](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/abe/people/darren.robinson). I started in February.

I have been given your contact details by Chris Parry and Jeremy Morley . I am also working with Jeremy, who was my short-lived boss until last week, on re-building a spatial web-service for public exposure. 

As part of the Leverhulme project we are planning on building a data repository and data processing environment (distinguishing between our archiving and metadata commitments and our data processing requirements). I have been in touch with Chris Parry and Christine Middleton in terms of the data repository components and am now looking at the data analysis environments. 

I appreciate that this is a rapidly changing area - especially as RCUK and the funding councils guidance on data sharing leads to increased expectations in analysis (and therefore analytical platforms). To avoid re-inventing the wheel I would like to find out:

* what analysis initiatives are ongoing in the university
	* what frameworks are supported
	* what aren't supported
* what the university will allow me to expose on the web (can I, for example, public expose a postgres database or a triple store)
* what are the infrastructure and cost issues
* how these are managed (is there institutional management of server and analytics platforms or is this left to individual projects/researchers)
* what the medium to long term data anlytics vision is for the university

Would it be possible for you to point me in the direction of any supporting information. Alternatively it would be good to meet up with either of you (I appreciate you both have busy schedules). I work 3 days a week (Monday to Wednesday).

I will follow this message up with a telephone call.

Best wishes

Ant
