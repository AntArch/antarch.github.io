# Agent Based Modelling

[In Python](http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/introduction-to-agentbased-models-an-implementation-of-schelling-model-in-python/144)

[PyABM](http://azvoleff.com/pyabm.html)

[ChitwanABM](http://azvoleff.com/chitwanabm)

This looks interesting in terms of City Dynamics


# Visualization

## [plotly](https://plot.ly)

## [Charted](https://medium.com/data-lab/introducing-charted-15161b2cd71e)

## [Visualising Statistics](http://stats.cwslive.wiley.com/details/feature/6314441/Visualising-Statistics-The-importance-of-seeing-not-just-describing-data.html)

# Cities

## [Land registry - 30 analyses in 30 days](http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/)

Excellent demonstration of deeper analysis


# Spatial patterns

## [The Plan to Map Illegal Fishing from Space](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/plan-map-illegal-fishing-space/)

Not read this - but thinking that they've using spatial patterns to match against known patterns. This might be useful to identify different forms of travel pattern (driving) or different ecological pattern (animal movement based upon GPS and inertial sensors)


# Unfiled

## [Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/table_of_contents.ipynb)

A text book - all in Ipython: YAY
