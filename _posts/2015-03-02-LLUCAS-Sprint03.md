# Sprint 03 2nd March - 16th March

Sprint Objectives:  


This sprint has the following sub-tasks:

* Repository discussions with Darren
* contact David Holland and Isabel Sargent @ OSGB. @os.uk
	* 03456 050505
	* Mention my name and ask if they can discuss what has been happening with their 3D city models research. I know Bournemouth was well covered in research (10 years ago ish) but it would be great to find out if/where this has been rolled out to. Also if they have plans could we ask they consider Nottingham etc. I have not kept  up with what has been happening in Photogrammetric Services at OS (and what LiDAR they have been looking at) and so would be good to know.
* Contact CMS people (if below don;t work then Jemma) look at SS rendering
	* Actually think this should be:
		* David Aldred
			* Web Manager
			* 0115 84 67476
			* david.aldred@nottingham.ac.uk
		* Tom Wright
			* Digital Engagement Manager 
			* 0115 95 13309
			* tom.wright@nottingham.ac.uk
		* Mr Andy Beggan 
			* Associate Director, LRLR Learning Technology
			* 0115 84 67707 
			* andy.beggan@nottingham.ac.uk
site request form - 
* Develop a data requirements/needs document that will act as a template across all the projects
* Get in touch with Data Analytics people
	* Didier - meeting arranged
	* [ADAC](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/adac/index.aspx)
		* Specifically [John Garibaldi - prof in Infoatics](http://ima.ac.uk/garibaldi) - who does semantic reasoning and decision support :-)
	* [James Goulding](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~psxjog/index.html)
* Project Workshop 20150311


## Tasks rolled over for the next sprint

* Thing to follow up: [Development of citizen based sensor systems](http://www.citi-sense.eu/) http://www.citi-sense.eu/

# Retrospective

Slightly disappointing in terms of getting the infrastructure in place for the ABP as a couple of things took longer than expected. The respotiory document was an unanticipated task. 



## What went well?

Repository document well received

## What have we learnt?

## What could we do better?


## What still puzzles us?



## What is blocking activity


# Task summary

## Repository

A repository discussion document was created for Darren (available in /home/arb/ownCloud/Nottingham/LLUCAS/Sprints/Sprint03/20150331_RepositoryForDarren) and summarised [here](http://antarch.calepin.co/data-repository-for-iea-project.html). Darren has requested a meeting in Sprint 4 to review this.



## CMS

### CHat and then email to David Aldred

Hi David,

Thanks for the chat. As promised here is an e-mail with my details. Below is the intro e-mail I sent to Jemma (cc'd in). I've also cc'd in the Pi Prof Darren Robinson and my line manager Dr Doreen Boyd.

As you gathered I would like a project website in the CMS. One of our requirements is for it to harvest content from the web and then re-render it within the CMS itself (basically so we don't have to double handle content creation). This is likely to include:

* Project papers (e-prints?)
* Project public/general output ([scribd?](https://www.scribd.com/))
* Project data or algorithms (the to be confirmed repository?)
* Presentations ([slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/))
* Videos/Audio (Youtube or Vimeo)

etc.

This is likely to use some form of RSS. We're unlikely to need the functionality immediately, however, knowing that it's possible means that we can get the rest of the team trained in using the CMS and producing content. If it's not possible then we may need to go a bit more bespoke (I did something similar using WordPress) possibly outside the university.

Jemma and I also had a really useful chat about the possibilities - but the ability to effectively harvest content stored on third party sites (or render RSS in an acceptable manner) was an unknown.

Darren: David has asked that we send in a request for the website using [this form](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/communicationsmarketing/teams/web-team/request-a-website/index.aspx). This needs some decision from you. Specifically:

* Title of new website (you were unsure as to whether to go for LUCAS or not)
* Desired URL (most tend to be sub URLs for the faculty - however as this is inter/multi-disciplinary and given that this may be a 'centre' (or other functional unit) I would suggest we put this at a higher level)

I can deal with everything else.

Best

Ant


## Contact OS about 3d and RS data

Really good chat with Isabel (02380 055779)- definitely someone who you can work with.

* data - research data licence
	* Aerial photo
		* 4 band
		* Stereo
		* NIR
	* Surface Model
	* Building Height 
		* enhancement to topo
* interested in the unknown unknowns
* Rollo Home - 3d
* [Alex Langlands](http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/archaeology/staff/Pages/dr-alexander-langlands.aspx) - landscape characterisation - winchester - archaeologists - interesting connection




###email sent

Dear All,

I've just had a good chat with Isabel (thanks for your time) as an initial introduction and I promised that I would send an e-mail that described the project, our requirements and potential future collaborations to you all. This is that e-mail. You'll find a summary of the project attached (this was used to request AddressBase data last month).

My name is Anthony Beck. I'm a research Fellow in Geography at Nottingham University working on a multi-disciplinary project called Sustaining Urban Habitats. This project is looking at 4 cities one of which is Nottingham in the UK. We are working within the [city of Nottingham boundary](https://secure.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/mRegisterOfficeBooking/NottinghamCityCouncilAdministrativeBoundary.pdf). My line managers are Doreen Boyd and Jeremy Morely (who will soon be with you), both of whom I believe you all know. The Project PI is Prof. Darren Robinson.

The longer term objective is to collaborate closely with the Ordnance Survey so we can develop methods and techniques that can be used to generate geospatial products which are designed for, or can be re-purposed towards, sustainable city management and to identify mechanisms to maximise the policy and decision making impacts. That's obviously ambitious. Isabel and I thought the best way to do this would be to arrange an initial meet at Southampton for knowledge exchange and to look at the best ways to collaborate. This may be best once Jeremy is in post.

In the short-term it would be really useful to get hold of some data to start familiarisation. Would it be possible to arrange access to:

* 2 sets of stereo aerial photos (including the NIR band) - for all the obvious - but to also included time change
* Recent DEMs
* Building heights (if the OSMM topo has this enhancement)

Is there anything I need to do to support this request? and if you are OK with this I assume I should go through Anne Patrick to formally request the data.

The 3d and CityGML is potentially going to be very important. Rollo: it would be really useful to talk to you about this when I come down.

Best wishes and many thanks.

Ant

## Other longer term data repository issues Darren is involved in

* Strategic research and innovation agenda
	* Darren is writing this
	* Would like
		* 2 or 3 city observatories
		* Very highly instrumented
		* Put in a strong bid for Nottingham
	* Funding
		* Europe
		* ESRC


* Annex 66
	* Behavioural modelling
	* Put together a data repository
		* Can make the data available to the academic community
	* Conversation around this - later in the week
	* I want to think about this in terms of the carrot and stick approach to encouraging participation - the strategy and firewalling option has implications for the licenses. There may be a short-term/long-term incompatibilities.
