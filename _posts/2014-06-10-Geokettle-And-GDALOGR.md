# Background

I've just bought [Applying and Extending Oracle Spatial](http://www.packtpub.com/applying-and-extending-oracle-spatial/book) by Simon Greener who is a tad of a hero. This post is a collection of notes on the section covering data import (Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)) using open source tools. Specifically [Geokettle](http://www.spatialytics.org/projects/geokettle/) and [GDAL/OGR](http://gdal.org/ GDAL is for Raster and OGR is for vector).
