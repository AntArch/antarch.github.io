<h1>Data analysis</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of ISO writing to USB and SD drives recently - #dontAsk. I&#39;ve been getting a rather worrying number of these:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Invalid partition table - recursive partition on /dev/****</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To fix this go into terminal and do the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/AAAAAA bs=1M</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where AAAAAA refers to your drive (normally sdb or sdc).</p>

<p>This takes quite a long time to process. Once complete re-configure your drive in Gparted.</p>
