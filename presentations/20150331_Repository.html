<p>The Shakespeare review <span class="citation" data-cites="shakespeare_shakespeare_2013">(2013)</span> indicate that the amount of government Open Data, at least in the UK, is only going to grow.</p>
<p>Open data has the potential to trigger a revolution in how governments think about providing services to citizens and how they measure their success: this produces societal impact. This will require an understanding of citizen needs, behaviours, and mental models, and how to use data to improve services. A McKinsey Global Institute report examines the economic impact of Open Data <span class="citation" data-cites="mckinsey_open_2013">(McKinsey 2013)</span> and estimates that globally open data could be worth a minimum of $3 trillion annually.</p>

<p>Within academia the underlying rationale of Open Data is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>unfettered access to large amounts of ‘raw’ data enables patterns of re-use and knowledge creation that were previously impossible.</li>
<li>The creation of a rich, openly accessible corpus of data introduces a range of data-mining and visualisation challenges, which require multi-disciplinary collaboration across domains (within and outside academia) if their potential is to be realised.</li>
<li>An important step towards this is creating frameworks which allow data to be effectively accessed and re-used.</li>
<li>The prize for succeeding is improved knowledge-led policy and practice that transforms communities, practitioners, science and society</li>

<ul>
<li>Most academics see data sharing as a specific stage in the research data life-cycle.</li>
<li>Such sharing tends to occur at the end of a project as part of an archiving and exposure process.</li>
<li>Whilst, many academics are <em>expected</em> to archive their data, few do.
<ul>
<li>Up until recently there has been little incentive to do so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The policy changes instituted by some research councils are likely to see a change in this situation.</li>
<li>Even so, a significant amount of data will exist in a <em>limbo</em>: the community is aware it exists but can not get access to it.</li>
<li>This has created a paucity of data - one approach to alleviate this is to provide access to data at a much earlier stage in the research life-cycle.</li>

<ul>
<li>Providing access to data earlier in the research life-cycle is a significant change in research practice.</li>
<li>It is likely that those who contribute would like to ensure that the data they have spent many hours collecting and refining is not misappropriated and whilst others can gain insight from the data that they have the ability to exploit the data effectively <strong>and</strong> are credited appropriately by others.</li>
<li>An open licence at such an early stage would mean that contributors got credit for their contribution but might not maximise their personal impact (the data is cited but the data collectors are not invited to be co-authors on a resulting high impact <em>Nature paper</em>).</li>
<li><p>In this scenario the research process as a whole benefits but there is a disincentive for those people who collect high quality data to share it so early.</p></li>
<li>An alternative solution is a members club.</li>
<li>A <em>closed ecosystem</em> in which members get access to critical data, algorithms and other resources at an earlier stage in the research life-cycle for the common good of the group.</li>
<li>The <em>benefits</em> of sharing are access to the <em>cumulative resources</em> shared by the group with the aim of increasing <em>research output</em> accordingly.</li>

<li>Many view the primary function of a repository to store or archive resources and to facilitate discovery through metadata.</li>
<li>There is a difference between storage and archiving. <em>Storage</em> can be any simple process that takes the resources as it stands and makes it available for others through the repository.</li>
<li><em>Archivation</em> is an active process that attempts to ensure that the resource is re-useable in the future.</li>
<li>To a digital archivist standards, well documented formats, open formats and format migration are important concepts.</li>

<h2>slide notes</h2>
<p>Once stored the resource need a mechanism to be discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each resource contains metadata (<em>data about data</em>) that can be used to describe any aspect of the resource.</li>
<li>The discovery process is facilitated by standards and schemas - for example <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> is a commonly used metadata schema and the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI-PMH</a>) is a protocol for sharing metadata.</li>
<li>The sharing of metadata (normally under an open <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0 licence</a> licence) through technologies like OAI-PMH means that information about the data (including its storage location) can be shared between different harvesting environments.</li>
<li>This is designed to increase <em>discovery</em>.
<ul>
<li>When a potential end-user searches for resources via such a <em>domain repository</em> results can be displayed from different source repositories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Re-use</em> is ultimately what repositories want to facilitate. More specifically they should facilitate the clear re-use of the research object in a mannner where the re-user understands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The licence under which the resource is shared</li>
<li>Who and how to credit the provider of the resource</li>
<li>The provenance of the resource</li>
<li>The potential uses to which the resource may be put</li>
<li>The constraints associated with the resource</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the context of a data environment a data repository may not provide (or expose) the data in a manner which means it can be used directly within a workflow.</li>
<li>Whilst some repositories provide API's to provide views over the data - the underlying formats and infrastructure may not be optimised for large-scale processing.</li>

<li>A licence in this context is a legal instrument for a rights holder to permit a second party to do things that would otherwise infringe on the rights held.</li>
<li>A waiver, by contrast, is a legal instrument for giving up one’s rights to a resource, so that infringement becomes a non-issue.
<ul>
<li>Note that a waiver does not authorise other parties to claim rights – as opposed to freedoms – they did not previously have.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Two lead organisations have developed legal frameworks for content licensing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons (CC)</a> and</li>
<li><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/">Open Data Commons (ODC)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until the release of <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">CC version 4</a>, published in November 2013, the CC licence did not cover data. Between them, CC and ODC licences can cover all forms of digital work.</p>
</section>
<section id="licence-constraints" class="level2">
<h2>Licence constraints</h2>
<p>Constraints can be added to the top level licence by employing the following clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>BY – By attribution: the licensee must attribute the source.</li>
<li>SA – Share-alike: if the licensee adapts the resource, they must release the adapted resource under the same licence.</li>
<li>NC – Non commercial: the licensee must not use the work within a commercial activity without prior approval.</li>
<li>ND – No derivatives: the licensee can not derive new content from the resource.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Restrictive clauses have the potential to produce license incompatibilities -</p>
<ul>
<li>CC-BY-SA can not be combined with CC-BY-SA-NC</li>
<li>CC-BY-NC should not be combined with CC-BY-SA (what happens to the NC?)</li>

<ul>
<li>Bespoke repositories (likely to be based on an open source framework) have a high management and cost overhead and will require the hiring of skilled personel to <em>'reinvent the wheel'</em>.<br /></li>
<li>Most institutional repositories simply don't yet exist, are immature or cater exclusively on the needs of the host institution (as opposed to a broad consortium from different, or no, institutions).</li>
<li>Neither bespoke or institutional repositories tend to have robust bulk ingest or collaborations tools (beyond that provided by the source application) and may not have DOI minting capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Zenodo over figshare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zenodo was funded through <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a> in FP7.</li>
<li>Zenodo is free (for deposition and re-use for open and closed data).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://figshare.com/pricing">Figshare has individual and institutional pricing</a>. This may become complex when sharing data between multiple collaborators.<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The modes of accreditation (for example Google, Twitter, ORCID, OpenAIRE) in Zenodo are broader than FigShare.</li>
<li>The Open and Closed community element is also more flexible and is not made unduly complex with a pricing infrastructure.</li>
<li>With Horizon 2020 backing it is likely that Zenodo will see greater innovation (for example automated metadata creation is already implemented).</li>
<li>Zenodo integrates with GitHub and DropBox and is actively developing bulk metadata ingest capabilities.</li>
