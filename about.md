I like all things to do with space, place and informatics. 

I am a researcher with expertise in remote sensing, knowledge management, open data, data processing, data integration and (spatial) data analytics specifically in the heritage, environmental and urban infrastructure domains. I am part of a number of international networks covering heritage prospection, heritage and ecology data management and spatial data integration. 

I have a broad interest in the life-cycle of geospatial data; from collection, management, transformation and heterogeneous integration, to consumption by different user groups. 

I have been responsible for over Â£800k of research funding and was shortlisted for the Royal Academy of Engineering Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. Downstream industrial exploitation of my research has resulted in industry awards. I have co-ordinated major multi-disciplinary grants. - See more at: [OrcID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-811X#sthash.kQwXC4CD.dpuf)
